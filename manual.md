              A Bitburner scriptpack by starg3n

# Intro
you are now a proud owner of the sapph1r3! scriptpack! \
this user manual will guide you through setting up the scripts,  \
to integrate them into your workflow. 

## SETTING UP VHACK, GROW, AND WEAKEN 
  vhack lets you hack servers without connecting to them, vgrow and vweak \
  lets you do grow and weak remotley as well. \ 
  you can set this up like so: 
  > alias vhack=vhack.js
  > alias vgrow=vgrow.js
  > alias vweak=vweak.js
  the syntax for each of these is as follows
  > vhack [servername]
  > vgrow [servername]
  > vweak [servername]

## SETTING UP DAEMON.js
  daemon is basically an auto money generator. Daemon depends on:
  - helpers.js
  - go.js
  - stockmaster.js
  You CAN always just "run daemon.js" but it is quicker + better to do
  > alias start=daemon.js --silent-misfires true

## SETTING UP SERVERMONITOR.js
  servermonitor lets you see important data about servers you can access. \
  this is helpful for hacking them. You can set this up by running 
  > alias monitor=servermonitor.js
  running servermonitor now is as easy as 
  > monitor [servername]

## ALL ABOUT BITFETCH.js
  bitfetch is a dumbed down demake of neofetch / fastfetch for bitburner. \
  setting up bitfetch is very easy: 
  > alias bitfetch=bitfetch.js
  running the bitfetch command displays ASCII art of the bitburner logo \
  and other stats, such as a SAPPH1RE installation check. \
  there is some minor docs inside of the file, 
  > nano bitfetch.js 
  and you can modify the ascii, or the modules as you wish, although \
  it may not be easy, as it was made without thinking about modding.

## ALAINBRYDEN.js - WHAT IS IT?
  ALAINBRYDEN, or AB as it will be mentioned here is an installer \
  for alainbryden's pack of scripts, which daemon is in. \
  these scripts are more advanced, so you can visit his github: \
